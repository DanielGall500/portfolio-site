<p>Data Cleaning - In the real world, datasets are very often filled with missing values, inconsistent labeling, and in need of further preprocessing such as the creation of new columns. Only then should they be used for harvesting insights and the training of statistical models. I will work with you in a professional and efficient manor throughout this cleaning process to create a working dataset that you directly use for analysis. 

Data Visualisation - Through a combination of tools we can work to visualise your data in the ways that you would like. Both static and interactive forms of visualisations can be carried out, with the potential for web integration if so desired. I primarily work with Python data visualisation packages, however the tools used for this can be adapted to the needs of the client.

Data Analysis / Mining - Finding insights - the common end goal of creating datasets in the first place. Often you would like to gather insights from your data that will determine important decisions, but it’s often difficult to know where to begin. For this, we can work together to examine your data and objectives, and determine what type of analysis would be suitable, typically through a combination of statistical tests and data visualisation.

Natural Language Processing - If you have a task to be performed with language / text data, I can provide you with the services you require. I currently work on research at Ireland’s largest NLP research centre and work every day with speech and text data. This can range from the application of simple linguistic analyses such as tokenisation, POS tagging and dependency parsing, to the creation of language models as for the classification of a given tweet’s mood given the content or translation from one language to another.</p>
